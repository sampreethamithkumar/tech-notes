# Understanding Shebang (`#!`)

## What is a Shebang?
A **shebang** (`#!`) is the first line of a script file that tells the system which interpreter to use when executing the script.

## Why Use `#!/usr/bin/env`?
Instead of hardcoding the interpreter path (e.g., `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/python3`), using `#!/usr/bin/env <interpreter>` makes scripts more **portable**.

## How It Works
1. The system reads the shebang line in the script:
   ```sh
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   ```
2. The `env` command searches for `python3` in the directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.
3. It executes the first `python3` it finds.

## Example
### **Python Script (`script.py`)**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
print("Hello, World!")
```
To make the script executable:
```sh
chmod +x script.py
./script.py
```

## Why Not Just Use `/usr/bin/python3`?
Hardcoding `/usr/bin/python3` makes the script dependent on Python being installed exactly at that path. On different systems:
- It might be `/usr/local/bin/python3`
- On macOS with Homebrew, it could be `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`
- Virtual environments may provide a different `python3` path

Using `#!/usr/bin/env python3` ensures that the system finds the correct `python3` version in the current environment.

## When to Use and Avoid `env`
âœ… Use it when:
- You want the script to work across different UNIX-based systems.
- You're using virtual environments where `python3` is dynamically located.

ðŸš« Avoid it when:
- You need to use a specific, fixed Python version.
- Security policies restrict using `env` to resolve executables dynamically.

### **Checking Your Python Path**
To see where `python3` is located on your system:
```sh
which python3
```
Example output:
```
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
```
This is the path that `env` will find and use.

### **Key Takeaways**
- `#!/usr/bin/env python3` makes scripts **portable**.
- It searches for `python3` in the user's `PATH` instead of relying on a fixed location.
- Recommended when working in different environments or with virtual environments.
